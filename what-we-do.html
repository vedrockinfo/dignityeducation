                    inclusive environment where every child feels valued and encouraged to reach their full potential.
                    Through their innovative teaching method, ALFA (Accelerated Learning For All), One Tara School is

                    slums, and gaining a deeper understanding of diverse life experiences. This opportunity has
                    significantly boosted my confidence, refined my skills, and taught me professionalism in a workplace

                    the one year that I have spent with the organisation, I have had a plethora of experiences from vising
                    slums every morning and gathering students to visiting IAS officers to invite them to our events and
                    collaborate with them on our projects. Being a part of the organisation has not just developed my
                    personality but changed me as a person as a whole! Working closely with the founder, Dr Sunita Gandhi, I
                    have had the opportunity to witness her dedication towards her goal of eradicating illiteracy and it is
                    nothing less inspiring. With the right support and approach, DEVI Sansthan has the potential of change

                  <p>I am writing this testimonial as I had got this golden opportunity to do this wonderful job i.e., to
                    educate our upcoming generation who are not privileged somehow to go and study. I believe that every
                    individual has the right to study and grow in life.</p>
                  <p>At the outset, I was a little bit nervous when I received this great offer. A lot of thoughts were
                    running into my mind like how will I manage all the students, will they listen to me, will I be able to
                    complete my assigned task i.e., to educate them. So yes I was nervous. Moreover, I knew that a teacher
                    plans a very crucial role in a student's life so I had to do this right & also this was my first
                    experience.
                    One Tara has given me that platform through which I was able to overcome that nervousness inside of

                      cousins. Each one of them had their own
                      struggles with school, which had kept them from literacy. Inama was a diligent
                      student but found it difficult to rote
                      memorize the letters. Heena was a quick learner but spent most of the day doing
                      domestic chores, and thus had little
                      time for study. Meanwhile Muskan suffered from a liver ailment which kept her from
                      attending school. Despite these
                      difficulties, each of the three girls learnt to read in just 1 to 2 months. Their

              <div class="space-three"></div>
              <p>In this transformative era, “ALfA: Accelerating Learning for All” stands as a beacon of innovative
                pedagogy, promising to reshape the very contours of education. ALfA is the product of a twentyyear
                journey of discovering what works in education and applying it in the classroom. It represents a
                fresh attempt to teach reading in a way that is both effective and enjoyable, methodical and
                meaningful.</p>
              <p>Breaking the shackles of the industrial education system, ALfA revolutionizes the school experience
                through peer learning and hands-on activities. The program enables both children and adults to
                acquire foundational literacy and numeracy in months rather than years. Beyond just reading,
                writing, and arithmetic, ALfA builds essential life skills such as collaboration, creativity,
                citizenship, and character.</p>
