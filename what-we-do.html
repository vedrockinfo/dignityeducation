                                struggles with school, which had kept them from literacy. Inama was a diligent
                                student but found it difficult to rote
                                memorize the letters. Heena was a quick learner but spent most of the day doing
                                domestic chores, and thus had little
                                time for study. Meanwhile Muskan suffered from a liver ailment which kept her from
                                attending school. Despite these
                                difficulties, each of the three girls learnt to read in just 1 to 2 months. Their
                                efforts showed us from the beginning
                                that the dream of literacy for all is really possible.</p>

                <p>Breaking the shackles of the industrial education system, ALfA revolutionizes the school experience
                  through peer learning and hands-on activities. The program enables both children and adults to
                  acquire foundational literacy and numeracy in months rather than years. Beyond just reading,
                  writing, and arithmetic, ALfA builds essential life skills such as collaboration, creativity,
                  citizenship, and character.</p>
